# The Other Things

*The Other Things* is a collection of experiments in code for Arduino, Adafruit Feather, and other nrf52840 based boards to explore how sensor data od the body can be captured usefully for creative prortotyping.
These explroations are part of research activities investigating wearable Internet of Things and the Self within [OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org.).

# Repository Contents

* **/Arduio** - C/C++ code for Arduino and Adafruit Feather boards
* **/Circuit Pyhton** - Prototypes written in Circuit Python for the Adafruit Feather Sense board enabling quicker iterations between code and testting.
* **/tools/** - Contains custom tools and utility scripts for data handling and analysis.

# Notes

To enable Circuit Python on the Adafruit nrf52840 Feather Sense, follow this guide: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-sense/circuitpython-on-feather-sense

Exmaple code for the *Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Sense* can found / is copied form here: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-sense

To test the *Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Sense* board this example sketch from the Adafruit tutorial: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/blob/main/Adafruit_Feather_Sense/feather_sense_sensor_demo/feather_sense_sensor_demo.ino

Some sketches are using an RTC clock. The module mus be initial set to a spcific date and time; also repeat after every battery change. The **/tools** folder contains the ubiquitous `RTCSetClock` sketch which can be found on many forums and tutorials. However, there is no URL where the code is hosted. Hence it is included in this repository with its respective copyright and license in the header of the file.

# A simple pedometer using an Arduino Nano 33 BLE

Aims:

- to understand how a simple pedometer works
- connect to a data storage device via BLE
- act as a haptic output device
- incorporate the open source [C-Step-Counter](https://github.com/MarcusNordstrom/C-Step-Counter) for Arduino compilation
    - enhance the scientific chain of code reference

These explroations are part of research activities investigating wearable Internet of Things and the Self within [OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org.).
